    <p>Here is the stuff for the 'about me' section.  I've lived in the Seattle area for over 15 years.  I'm an avid cyclist, who's excited about a career change into software development.  My coding experience is pretty much none.  Played around with a Vic 20 & Commodore 64 in the '80's.  I was able to successfully partion a drive, install Ubuntu, Sublime & Fish on my own to get ready for this course.  That was fun to do. </p>
