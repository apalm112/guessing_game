Changed the code to add an image to the JS file & a CSS file.  In lab we decided the code was a bit complex to be able to change the wrong answer text to red.

10/31/15  Was able to change the code to turn text green or red depending on user answer & show image properly.  Move my repo into the proper directory in order to for the GitHub -gh pages to work.
